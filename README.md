### Project Overview
This project analyzes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC), focusing on its financial performance, industry position, and future growth potential. Key insights include profitability trends, operational efficiency, and market dominance, with a recommendation to invest based on projected value and sustained growth.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is an Excel file downloaded directly from Morningstar, containing TSMC’s financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow data for the past three years.

### Tools

The primary tool used for this analysis was Excel, which facilitated data cleaning, organization, and analysis of TSMC's financial statements to extract key insights and trends.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

The data cleaning and preparation in Excel involved organizing the financial statements into structured tables, ensuring consistency in formatting, and handling missing or duplicate values. Key tasks included standardizing column headers, aligning date formats, calculating derived metrics like percentage changes and ratios, and converting financial data from TWD to USD using appropriate exchange rates to ensure compatibility with the analysis. Pivot tables were also created to facilitate deeper insights into TSMC's financial performance, ensuring the dataset was accurate, well-structured, and ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis, conducted in Excel, began with organizing and examining the common-size financial statements to identify patterns in revenue, cost management, and profitability. Key observations included consistently high net profit margins above 37% and significant revenue growth in 2022 (42.6%), followed by a slight decline in 2023 due to rising costs.
Further EDA involved calculating critical financial ratios, such as the current ratio (above 2.0) for liquidity, asset turnover (41.19%) for operational efficiency, and accounts receivable turnover, which improved from 9.43 in 2022 to 10.03 in 2023, reflecting enhanced cash collection efficiency. The percentage change analysis highlighted disproportionate increases in revenue relative to costs during periods of growth, showcasing TSMC’s strong financial management.
This detailed exploration of trends and metrics set the groundwork for deeper financial analysis, forecasting, and valuation efforts outlined in the final project report.

### Data Analysis
1. Data Organization and Cleaning:
Financial data from the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement was formatted into structured tables.
Currency values were converted from TWD to USD using the appropriate exchange rates to standardize calculations.
2. Common-Size and Percentage Change Analysis:
Common-size financial statements were created by dividing each line item by total revenue (income statement) or total assets (balance sheet), enabling trend identification across years.
Percentage change analysis calculated year-over-year variations for key financial accounts to evaluate growth rates and pinpoint shifts in financial performance.
3. Ratio Calculations:
- Liquidity Ratios: Metrics like the current ratio were calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities, providing insights into short-term financial health.
- Efficiency Ratios: Accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover were derived by dividing net sales by average receivables and cost of goods sold by average inventory, respectively, to assess asset       
  utilization and cash cycle efficiency.
- Profitability Ratios: Return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) were computed by dividing net income and operating profit by respective denominators (assets and capital employed) to gauge the 
  company’s returns.
- Leverage and Stability Metrics: Capital structure leverage and interest coverage ratios were calculated to evaluate the company’s reliance on debt and ability to manage interest obligations.
4. Trend Visualization:
Excel tools such as pivot tables and charts were employed to visualize trends, such as year-over-year growth in revenue and changes in operating efficiency.
Conditional formatting was used to highlight significant variances, making it easier to interpret results.
5. Cross-Referencing:
Results from ratio analyses were cross-referenced with raw data to validate accuracy and identify discrepancies.
Historical data trends were compared to industry benchmarks for context.

### Results/Findings

The analysis of TSMC’s financial data yielded several key findings:
1. Strong Profitability:
TSMC consistently maintained high net profit margins (37–43%) and gross profit margins (51–59%), reflecting effective cost management and strong pricing power in the semiconductor industry.
Operational expenses were kept below 12% of revenue, allowing for significant reinvestment into R&D and capacity expansion.

2. Robust Growth Trends:
Revenue experienced a remarkable 42.6% growth in 2022, driven by increased global demand for semiconductors. However, a slight decline in 2023 (-4.5%) highlighted the impact of external macroeconomic challenges and rising costs.

3. Efficient Asset Utilization:
An asset turnover ratio of 41.19% indicated efficient use of resources to generate revenue.
Improvements in accounts receivable turnover (from 9.43 to 10.03) suggested enhanced cash collection efficiency, supporting operational liquidity.

4. Financial Stability:
The current ratio consistently remained above 2.0, signaling strong short-term liquidity.
Substantial cash reserves (over 25% of total assets) and moderate leverage (capital structure ratio declining to 1.588 by 2023) underscored TSMC’s ability to balance growth with financial prudence.

5. Investment in Growth:
Heavy investments in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which accounted for over 50% of total assets, reflected TSMC’s commitment to maintaining technological leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

6. Valuation and Forecasting Insights:
Forecasts based on historical trends indicated sustained revenue and profit growth, supported by TSMC’s dominant market position and strategic investments.
The discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation suggested the stock was undervalued, offering a strong investment opportunity.

### Recommendations
